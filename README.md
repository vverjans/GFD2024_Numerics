# GFD2024_Numerics
This repository includes the notebooks associated with the set of two lectures for the "Numerical methods" chapter in the "Geophysical Fluid Dynamics" course 2024 at Pusan National University.

The theory for the chapter material is covered in class. These notebooks are codes to support the theory. A short theory summary is provided in each notebook.
The programming language is Python, and notebooks are displayed with jupyter notebook. To run the notebooks, you can simply download the github folder. For all functionalities, you will need the following libraries:
- jupyter
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
